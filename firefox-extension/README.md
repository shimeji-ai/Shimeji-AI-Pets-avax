# Shimeji Firefox Extension 🦊🐱

A lightweight Firefox add-on that drops a digital mascot (a "shimeji") onto every page. The mascot follows your pointer while you move and wanders when idle. Connect an EVM wallet (MetaMask, Core, or WalletConnect) to sync your account and unlock NFT characters.

## Features

- **Pointer follow / wander:** Mascots follow the pointer while you move, and wander autonomously when idle.
- **EVM wallet connect:** Connect your wallet from the hosted profile page to sync your account and NFT unlocks.
- **Lightweight:** Minimal permissions and a simple UI for toggling mascots and settings.

## Quick install (dev mode)

1. Open Firefox and go to `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox`.
2. Click **Load Temporary Add-on** and select `manifest.json` from this folder.
3. Visit https://shimeji-avax.vercel.app (or enable the addon from the toolbar entry) to see the mascot appear.

## How it works (high level)

- Background script (`background.js`) listens for UI events and manages extension state.
- Content scripts (`content.js`, `dapp_content_script.js`) inject the mascot and handle pointer/wander behavior.
- `config.html` and `popup.html` provide a simple UI for toggling mascots and settings.
- Wallet connection is handled on the hosted profile page (https://shimeji-avax.vercel.app/my-profile).

## Five testable milestones

Follow these steps to verify core functionality locally. Each milestone includes expected results and where to look in the code.

- **Milestone 1 — Install and show default mascot:**

  - Steps: Install the extension using the Quick install steps above. Open https://shimeji-avax.vercel.app (or enable it for your current site in the popup).
  - Expected result: A mascot appears on the page and wanders around.
  - Files: See [content.js](content.js) and [manifest.json](manifest.json).

- **Milestone 2 — Pointer follow behavior:**

  - Steps: Move your mouse around the page. Observe the mascot's motion.
  - Expected result: While you move the pointer, the mascot follows the cursor smoothly; when you stop moving the pointer, after a short delay the mascot returns to wandering mode.
  - Files: Behavior implemented in [content.js](content.js) and helper logic in [dapp_content_script.js](dapp_content_script.js).

- **Milestone 3 — Toggle mascots via UI:**

  - Steps: Open the extension popup via the toolbar icon (or open [popup.html](popup.html) directly). Select a different mascot if available.
  - Expected result: The selected mascot replaces the current one on the page.
  - Files: See [popup.html](popup.html) and [popup.js](popup.js) for selection flow; mascot assets live in `characters/` and `icons/`.

- **Milestone 4 — Open the wallet connect page:**
  - Steps: Open [config.html](config.html). Use the button to open the hosted connection page.
  - Expected result: The profile page opens in a new tab; if connected it redirects to your wallet profile.
  - Files: See [config.html](config.html) and [config.js](config.js).

- **Milestone 5 — Connect wallet:**
  - Steps: Open the profile page on the web app and click connect. Follow wallet prompts.
  - Expected result: Your public key appears, and the extension receives the connection message.
  - Files: Message bridge lives in [dapp_content_script.js](dapp_content_script.js).

## Architecture Note: Externally Hosted Pages

**Important:** Wallet connection runs on hosted web pages (not served from the extension).

### Hosted web pages:
- My Profile page in the web app (`/my-profile`)

### Why external hosting?
- Wallet providers and auth flows run on http/https pages, NOT moz-extension:// pages
- External pages do NOT have access to Firefox extension APIs (`browser.runtime`, etc.)
- Communication happens via `window.postMessage` through the content script bridge

### Message Flow:
```
My Profile (web) <-> dapp_content_script.js (injected) <-> background.js (extension)
```

### When updating:
1. Deploy updated web app files
2. Reload the addon via `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` to update content scripts and background.js

## Developer notes

- **Background script:** [background.js](background.js) — handles extension-wide events and wallet connection state.
- **Content injection & behavior:** [content.js](content.js) (mascot rendering) and [dapp_content_script.js](dapp_content_script.js) (message bridge for hosted web page).
- **Popup UI:** [popup.html](popup.html) + [popup.js](popup.js) + [popup.css](popup.css).
- **Config / test UI:** [config.html](config.html) + [config.js](config.js) (opens https://shimeji-avax.vercel.app/my-profile).
- **Manifest:** [manifest.json](manifest.json) — permissions and content script definitions.

## Testing tips

- Wallet providers only run on secure contexts. If testing a local connection page, use HTTPS or a secure tunnel.

## Next steps / enhancements

- Add more mascots and animations in `../runtime-core/characters/` and run `npm run sync-runtime-core`.
- Add an egg unlock flow once egg purchases go live.
- Add settings for mascot size, z-index, and persistence across tabs.

If you'd like, I can also run a quick check of the extension files or add a short demo script to toggle unlocks automatically.
